There are a lot of people in India that want to move from one place to another for thier jobs and their business.
Now as the project has to be similar to the battle of neighbourhoods. I would be comapring different cities in India 
based on different factors and categories. The major cities list is decided by the cities in India having the most 
population as these cities have a huge amount of businesses and employess.

As the top cities are decided based on popiuation I will first gain data about the lattitudes and longitudes of these
cities , make a dataframe out of the given data and represent the map using the folium library. Hence in the start you
can see all the cities highlighted on the map of India that would be taken into consideration.

After representing the initial data. Using foursquare I will find the attributes of each of the highlighted cities with
the help of FOURSQUAURE api and lattitudes and longitudes of the different cities. After gaining the attributes for each 
and every city. Using KMeans clustering algorithm i will find the similarities between different cities fiting data and 
obtaining labels.

Once all the cities are labelled based on their attributes. the cities will once again be represented using folium
based on their labels and similarities.This will help determine locations and cities in India which are similar as they
would be visually highlighted by the same color.and belong to the same label.
